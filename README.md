## TL;DR

D6 is an isomorphic JavaScript renderer. If you use Lighter with Ltl, D6 can
render your templates on the server side for the first request then lazy load
templates and render on the client for subsequent requests.

### What does D6 stand for?

Dynamically-Downloaded Data-Driven Documents, Dude.
